Title of the game is The Dream Of Time and was created for Games Programming Coursework.
Hey! This is the old version for the project.
I had to rebuild the project because of some script bug which happened on visual studio side, so this is the old version with which I could not merge the files so that the new project will not be bugging out of random files.
The in-dev name was ManoScape (random letters lol) and thats why the unreal project is called like that
